About Us
==========

This project was started by Zudi Lin (`@zudi-lin <https://github.com/zudi-lin>`_) and Donglai Wei (`@donglaiw <https://github.com/donglaiw>`_) 
in 2019 and supported by the **Visual Computing Group** (`VCG <https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu>`_) at Harvard University. PyTorch Connectomics 
is currently under active development, and besides handling connectomics data collected with electron microscopy (EM), we are extending the 
application to other biological structures and more imaging modalities (*e.g.*, micro-CT, fluorescence light microscopy).

Authors
------------
The following people are currently core contributors to PyTorch Connectomics's development and maintenance:

- `Zudi Lin <https://zudi-lin.github.io/>`_ - Applied Scientist at Amazon. Previous Ph.D. student in the Visual Computing Group at Harvard University.
- `Donglai Wei <https://donglaiw.github.io/>`_ - Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Boston College. Previous postdoctoral fellow in the Visual Computing Group at Harvard University.

Advisors
------------
The following people regularly provide suggestions on the design and future directions of the package:

- `Hanspeter Pfister <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister>`_ - Professor of Computer Science, Harvard University
- `Jeff Lichtman <https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/people/jeff-lichtman>`_ - Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University

Contributing
--------------

We would like to thank all current and previous `contributors <https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics/graphs/contributors>`_ to the PyTorch Connectomics package.

We are looking for motivated contributors to become collaborators and help out with the project. Besides opening issues and pull request on Github, please
join our `Slack community <https://join.slack.com/t/pytorchconnectomics/shared_invite/zt-obufj5d1-v5_NndNS5yog8vhxy4L12w>`_ to discuss bugs and feature 
requests. If you are interested in working on this project as a research intern at Harvard University or Boston College, please contact 
Prof. `Donglai Wei <https://github.com/donglaiw>`_ or Prof. `Hanspeter Pfister <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister>`_ via email for more details.
