## Jupyter notebook examples

The Jupyter notebook examples in this folder are used to test the functions and modules in the package with visualizations. List of current examples:

* [[augmentation](https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics/blob/master/notebooks/augmentation.ipynb)] visualizes the effects of several data augmentation techniques.
* [[blending](https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics/blob/master/notebooks/blending.ipynb)] visualizes the overlapping patterns of different blending functions in sliding-window inference.
* [[seg2affinity](https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics/blob/master/notebooks/seg2affinity.ipynb)] shows how the affinity map is generated from the ground-truth segmentation map.
* [[seg2distance](https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics/blob/master/notebooks/seg2distance.ipynb)] visualizes the distance transform map of the neuron segmentation masks.
